# Bambulab Studio Presets

Welcome to the Bambulab 3D Slicer Presets repository! This repository is dedicated to storing presets that have been meticulously crafted and optimized for use in 3D printing and slicing applications. Whether you're a 3D printing enthusiast, engineer, or designer, our collection of presets aims to simplify your workflow and elevate your 3D printing experience.

## Features

 * A growing collection of presets for Orca Slicer based 3D slicer applications.
 * Presets are meticulously optimized for quality and print performance.
 * Regular updates and additions to the preset library
 * Community-driven contributions and improvements.

## Getting Started
 1.  Explore the Presets: Browse through the preset categories and select the ones that match your 3D printing needs.
 2. Import Presets: Import the chosen presets into your 3D slicer software by following the provided instructions in the respective preset folders.
 3. Optimize Your Prints: Use the presets to optimize your 3D printing settings for superior print quality and efficiency.

For the best results please floow these instructions step by step.

 1. Begin with the Flow Dynamics Calibration steps provided in this official guide https://wiki.bambulab.com/en/software/bambu-studio/calibration_pa
 2. Use the Auto Calibration mode first, if that one does not successfully finish, please skip to step 4.
 3. Continue on with Auto Calibration mode for "Flow Rate Calibration" https://wiki.bambulab.com/en/software/bambu-studio/calibration_flow_rate
 4. Now to create preset as optimized as possible again do a manual check with Manual mode in Flow Dynamics Calibration
 5. So do the same Manual Calibration for the Flow Rate Calibration.

 * NOTE: Make sure when ever you got a calibration done, that you select the profile bevor doing the next calibration, as selecting a default profile will not make the best settings for both calibration methods.
